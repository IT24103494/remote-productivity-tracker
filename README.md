# Remote Worker Productivity AI/ML Project

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze and predict the productivity of remote workers.  
The goal is to identify the key factors influencing productivity, build predictive models, and generate insights to help improve efficiency in remote work environments.  

We use data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models to achieve these outcomes.
